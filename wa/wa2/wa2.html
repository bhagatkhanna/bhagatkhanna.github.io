    <h2> About me</h2>
    <div>
        <p> I am an undergraduate in CU Boulder's Creative Technology and Design program</p>
    </div>

    <h3> Interests</h3>
    <div>
        <p> I am passionate about rock climbing and wellness, coffee, listening to/making music, books, and movies. </p>
        <p>The last movie I watched was Mickey 17, it was great!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>My Goals</h3>
    <div>
        <p> Most fundamentally I am trying to live a creative life that enables me to use my lens on the world </p>
        <p>to create things that are beautiful and useful. Right now, that means developing a wide set of skills </p>
        <p>as I complete my degree and finding work in an industry like product design. It would be a dream for me </p>
        <p> to design and fabricate custom furniture. Also one day I want to climb a boulder called The Nest in Nevada. </p>
