                <h2 tabindex="6"> Micro-camper Van Reconversion</h2>
                <p> This fall I am reconverting my Kia Sedona into a micro-camper that I can use to take climbing trips.</p>
                <p> Previously I lived full-time in the van for nine months with a folding futon/bed, sink/fridge vanity,</p>
                <p> and enought storage for all my belongings. The reason for taking apart version one of the van was to </p>
                <p> reinstall the back row of seats and have it be functional as a car for more then just two poeple.</p>
                <p> This reconversion will tackle how the van can be maximally usable as both a car and a camper, while</p>
                <p> also providing a chance to up the craftsmanship.</p>
